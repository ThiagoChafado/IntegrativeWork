Cash Management System with Enhanced Features

The proposed system aims to develop a Cash Management System with added functionalities. The primary motivation behind this initiative is to address the current practice of manually recording sales transactions in notebooks. This manual process is time-consuming and error-prone, particularly when it involves calculating total sales and manually verifying cash balance.

Several key functionalities will be implemented within this system:

Add New Sale:

Users will have the ability to add new sales transactions. This feature will include fields for entering the sale's description, amount, payment method, and the associated salesperson for commission allocation.
Add Expense:

The system will allow users to record various expenses. This feature will include fields for entering the expense's description and amount.
Generate Reports:

The system will incorporate a reporting mechanism that utilizes data from the database to generate comprehensive monthly reports. These reports will encompass:

Total sales for the period.
Total expenses for the period.
Commissions earned by individual salespeople.
The system will include a main dashboard that dynamically displays newly added sales transactions. This dashboard will also provide a running subtotal of sales and expenses. Additionally, efforts will be made to implement a feature allowing the generation of daily sales reports in PDF format. These reports can be automatically sent to the system owner via email.

For the system's development, a web-based application will be utilized, along with a PostgreSQL database. In addition, various APIs will be integrated to ensure seamless functionality.

The user interface is expected to be intuitive, user-friendly, and responsive. It aims to streamline the process of entering new information while maintaining a visually appealing and modern presentation.
